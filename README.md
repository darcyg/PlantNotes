PlantNotes
==========

An open source environment sensor. Based on Plant Pi it allows measurements of any sensor over RF24.

PlantNotes uses RF24 signals (controlled by the Raspberry Pi) to receive data from our custom sensor board. 
It also allows users to control pumps or any other device via another relay board.
